# AutoTestingWeb
Hello.
This is a simple example of automation testing on the Djinni website.
I am not Pro, but this is a really interesting sphere.
Have a nice day.


*** Add ignore JS errors option ( run test:chrome:ignore)
**** Add in two test check status code (get response)
***** Added two tests for mobile in search test. If you want to use them, skip the first two (.skip) and unskip the second two. To run tests on the mobile, use the command "npm run test:chrome:qr".
****** Added faker library and modified singup test.
******* Added license for use faker library.
